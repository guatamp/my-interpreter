Hello, this is an interpreter I am currently working on.

It will be written fully in java, while referring to the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.

As of now, i have created a scanner that classifies the code into tokens along with a parser which adds all the tokens into a syntax tree.

Currently the interpreter can:
  -> Evaluate arithmetic and logical operations
  -> Evaluate print statemnts
