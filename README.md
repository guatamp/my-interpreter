Hello, this is an interpreter I am currently working on.

It will be written fully in java, while referring to the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.

As of now, i have created a scanner that classifies the code into tokens along with a parser which adds all the tokens into a syntax tree.

Currently the interpreter can:

  -> Evaluate arithmetic and logical operations

  -> Evaluate print statements

  -> Allow user to declare and intialize variables

  -> Evaluate for, if and while statements

  -> Allow use to declare and call functions
