Hello, this is an interpreter I am currently working on.

It will be written fully in java, while referring to the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom.

As of now, i have created a scanner that classifies the code into tokens. I am currently working on a parser that will create a syntax tree out of the generated tokens.
